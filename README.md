A few Windows 10 batch scripts I created & use [after every update]. Made with love.

## Scripts

### Fix VPN

Allowing more ciphers and the ability to use VPNs behind a NAT.

### No GFX Desktop

Cleaning up your desktop by removing the shortcuts \[which have extremely ugly icons\] to your GPU's settings utility. Doesn't remove it from the Start Menu or anywhere else, and only supports AMD, Intel, and nVidia.

### Tracker Killer

Getting rid of Windows 10's tracking mechanism in a way that avoids limiting functionality. Possibly the first telemetry blocker that doesn't ruin some fun for ya!
